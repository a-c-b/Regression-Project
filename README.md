# Regression-Project
files for the Regression Models project

They are the 
* test file.R 
* Project.RMD
* Course Project.PDF
 
The test file.R is the exploratory code and notes which were the "play with" code.  Some of it made it into the Markdown file, Course Project.RMD, some of it didn't.  The results, however, might have been included.  The markdown file is what created the .pdf output.
